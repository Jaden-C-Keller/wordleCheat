This is meant to help me cheat a bit at wordle, not really for pubic use but feel free to cheat with me :)

I know controls are not great but here they are:
Dropdown is used to chose row
Text field is for the word in that row
Set button is to set selected row to entered word
Click on a letter box to cycle color
